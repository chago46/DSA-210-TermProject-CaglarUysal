AI tools, including Cursor and GPT, were used to improve development efficiency by automating repetitive tasks such as executions report generation(logging), file input/output handling, and code commenting. The main functionality and logic of the project were implemented manually. AI assistance was also used to streamline machine learning workflows, including hyperparameter tuning with GridSearch.
