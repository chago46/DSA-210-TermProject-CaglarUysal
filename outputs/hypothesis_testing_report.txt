EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

KEY FINDINGS:
  H1: GRE scores show WEAK correlation with admission (r=-0.013, p=0.0232)
    → Interpretation: GRE scores alone are not strong predictors in this dataset
    → Action: Consider GRE as one factor among many, not a primary determinant
  H2: GPA correlation: 0.039
    → Most predictive factor: qs_Academic_Reputation_Score (r=-0.159)
    → Interpretation: GPA is NOT the most predictive factor
    → Action: Consider university prestige (QS rankings) as more important than GPA alone
  H3: Research Intensity shows SIGNIFICANT impact on admission
    → Tested using QS Research Intensity (qs_RES.) as proxy
    → Significant difference found (p=0.0000)
    → Action: Consider university research intensity in application strategy
  H5: University prestige correlates with GRE requirements
    → QS Overall Score vs GRE: r=0.307, p=0.0000
    → Interpretation: Higher prestige universities require higher GRE scores
    → Action: Match your GRE scores to universities' QS rankings
  H6: QS Rankings show STRONG correlations with admission
    → Strongest: qs_Academic_Reputation_Score (r=-0.159, p=8.79e-171)
    → Interpretation: University prestige (QS rankings) is a strong predictor
    → Note: Negative correlation suggests higher-ranked universities may have lower acceptance rates
    → Action: University selection strategy should prioritize QS rankings

DETAILED HYPOTHESIS RESULTS
================================================================================


HYPOTHESIS 1: H1: GRE and TOEFL correlation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  RESULTS:
    GRE Correlation: -0.0131
    P-value: 0.0232
    Significant: Yes
    Strength: Weak
  INTERPRETATION:
    - GRE scores show very weak correlation with admission probability
    - This contradicts the hypothesis that GRE strongly predicts admission
    - Possible reasons: dataset includes only accepted/rejected (binary), not probability
    - Or: GRE scores may be necessary but not sufficient
  RECOMMENDATION:
    - GRE scores should be considered alongside other factors
    - Focus on holistic application review rather than GRE alone


HYPOTHESIS 2: H2: GPA most predictive
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  RESULTS:
    Top 5 Most Predictive Factors:
      1. qs_Academic_Reputation_Score: r=-0.1595, p=8.79e-171
      2. qs_Citations_per_Faculty_Score: r=-0.1487, p=1.34e-148
      3. qs_Employer_Reputation_Score: r=-0.1460, p=3.28e-143
      4. qs_Employment_Outcomes_Score: r=-0.1453, p=9.37e-142
      5. qs_Faculty_Student_Score: r=-0.1452, p=1.15e-141

    GPA Correlation: 0.0389
  INTERPRETATION:
    - GPA is NOT the most predictive factor
    - qs_Academic_Reputation_Score has stronger correlation (-0.1595)
    - QS ranking scores show stronger negative correlations
    - This suggests university prestige matters more than individual GPA
  RECOMMENDATION:
    - Consider university prestige (QS rankings) in admission strategy
    - GPA is important but not the sole determinant
    - Focus on applying to universities where your GPA aligns with their standards


HYPOTHESIS 3: H3: Research experience impact
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  RESULTS:
    P-value: 0.0000
    Significant: Yes
    High Research Intensity mean: 0.0000
    Low Research Intensity mean: 0.6738
  INTERPRETATION:
    - Tested using QS Research Intensity (qs_RES.) as proxy for research focus
    - Categories: VH (Very High), HI (High), MD (Medium)
    - Significant difference found between research intensity levels
    - Higher research intensity universities show different admission patterns
  RECOMMENDATION:
    - Consider university research intensity when selecting target universities
    - Research-focused universities may have different admission criteria


HYPOTHESIS 4: H4: SOP and LOR moderate impact
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  STATUS: Could not be tested (missing data)

HYPOTHESIS 5: H5: University rating correlation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  RESULTS:
    GRE Correlation: 0.3070
    P-value: 0.0000
    Significant: Yes
  INTERPRETATION:
    - University prestige (QS Overall Score) shows correlation with GRE (r=0.3070)
    - Higher prestige universities require higher GRE scores
    - This confirms that top universities have higher admission standards
  RECOMMENDATION:
    - Target universities based on your GRE scores and their QS rankings
    - Higher-ranked universities require higher test scores
    - Use QS rankings to identify appropriate target universities


HYPOTHESIS 6: H6: Socioeconomic patterns
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  RESULTS:
    QS Rankings Correlations:
      qs_Overall_Score: r=-0.1447, p=1.14e-114
      qs_Academic_Reputation_Score: r=-0.1595, p=8.79e-171

    Cost of Living Correlations:
      No significant correlations found
  INTERPRETATION:
    - QS rankings show strong correlations (strongest: qs_Academic_Reputation_Score, r=-0.1595)
    - Negative correlations suggest higher-ranked universities may have lower acceptance rates
    - This could indicate: more selective admissions at top universities
    - Cost of living shows minimal impact on admission probability
    - Economic factors may not directly influence admission decisions
  RECOMMENDATION:
    - University selection should prioritize QS rankings
    - Consider that top-ranked universities may be more selective
    - Cost of living is not a primary factor in admission decisions
